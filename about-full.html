                        <img src="images/vibe1.jpg" alt="Early days of Harsh Dhaba" class="inline-image right">
                        <p>Harsh Dhaba and Restaurant started with a simple vision: to provide delicious, authentic Indian food in a warm and welcoming environment for everyone passing through Khairthal on Kishangarh Road. Founded by Mr. <b>Harish Kumar Babani S/o Mr. Vasudev Babani</b>. We wanted to create a space that felt like a home away from home, serving dishes made with love and the freshest local ingredients.</p>
                        <p>From our humble beginnings, we've grown thanks to the support of our loyal customers and our commitment to quality. We remember the early days, serving chai and parathas to truck drivers and local families, and those core values of hospitality and good food remain with us today.</p>
